    <p id="about-text">Hello, as stated my name is Norman. I started learning Front-End development a few years ago and enjoy coding and creating content. I am self-taught in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, including Bootstraps and jQuery. I have some
      experience with API, JSON, and Firebase and am always looking to learn more. I have learned from online-courses at Codecademy, Udemy, Lynda, and freecodecamp.com. I attended college in Waco, TX at Texas State Technical College (TSTC), for
      Automotive Technology. I have been in Technical Support roles for most of my career. I started learning Web Development and enjoyed what I was learning, and what the learning programs had me create. I aim to be a Senior Front End Developer
      one day and move to Full Stack Developer.</p>

    <hr class="hr-style">
    <p id="exp-text">My professional experience has been mostly in Technical Support roles, where I have provided technical and customer service for various companies on various products. My first job was at a local Honda dealership where I worked
      as a Minor Service Technician. Shortly after I changed roles to work as a Technical Support Representative, I have provided support for some of the following companies: </p>
    <ul id="jobs">
      <li>Xbox Support</li>
      <li>Dell</li>
      <li>Sears</li>
      <li>Blizzard Entertainment</li>
      <li>Electronic Arts</li>
      <li>Geek Squad</li>
      <li>Homeaway</li>
    </ul>
    <p id="exp-text">
      While working in the Technical Support, I have gained experience with Windows OS, Salesforce, Microsoft Office, Google Docs, Hangouts, Chrome OS, and Data Entry. One of my recent positions was a Subject Matter Expert. My roles were to
      provide support to the Tier 1 agents, tracking production floorâ€™s adherence, take over Supervisor request calls, completed side-by-sides plus provide coachings tips for the Tier 1 agents.<br>However, I do have personal and educational
      experience with creating websites and small apps. I have learned from Lynda, Udemy, Codecademy, and other online courses and have received certificates that I have attached to my LinkedIn page.</p>
